# MDsimulateA12
This is a project that to grab pdb data files generated by the MD simualation. Each "Model" stands for a moment of state of the protein. Given the aimed residue/domain, it will find out all of the residues within 5A and count the frequency by count_5A_model/total_model.

In order to use it, install the java JDK11 at least. Put your pdb files in the same folder where contains your src and bin folder.
Type "java -cp bin resn.Main --pdb=wild.pdb --log=wild.log", where --pdb= followed by the pdb file and --log= followed by your log file which records your results.
The --log= is optional. If this part is ignored, then "log.log" file will be generated automatically and save your results.
All of the input is case-insenstive.
